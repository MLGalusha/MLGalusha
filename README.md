## About Me

I'm Mason, a **frontend enthusiast** who loves exploring full-stack development whenever I feel like it. Instead of chasing a job title or a rigid plan, I'm diving into projects that **excite** meâ€”because that's where real learning (and fun!) happens.

---

## Why Iâ€™m Shifting My Approach

- **Itâ€™s All About Fun**: When I treat coding like a video game, I learn faster and enjoy the process more.  
- **Follow the Curiosity**: I let my curiosity lead me down rabbit holes around frontend (and sometimes backend).  
- **Project-First Learning**: Every project is a sandbox. I pick an idea that excites me, then build until it works (or until I break it completelyâ€”then fix it).  

---

## Current Projects & Plans

- **Full-Stack Experimentation**: Building a project that blends frontend + backend just because I want to see if I can.  
- **Portfolio Website**: Creating a place to showcase my work (and break it often as I learn new skills).  
- **Future AI Integration**: Eventually, Iâ€™ll weave in AI knowledge from my bootcamp to level up some of these projects.

## How Iâ€™m Learning

- **Daily Code Sessions (10 hours)**: Until the end of February, Iâ€™m going all-in on coding every day.
- **March Transition**: Plan to do ~7 hours of coding + 3 hours of networking daily. (Not my favorite part, but necessary!)
- **Hands-On, Not Just Tutorials**: Tutorials are fine for quick references, but I learn by **doing** and making mistakes.

---

## Goals for the Next Few Months

- **Keep Having Fun**: If Iâ€™m not enjoying it, I pivot. No more forcing myself down a path that isnâ€™t exciting.  
- **Build & Break Projects**: The best way to learn is to experiment, fail, fix, and repeat.  
- **Explore What Interests Me**: From design patterns to state management to interesting APIsâ€”whatever sparks my curiosity that day.  
- **Eventually Land a Frontend Role**: Iâ€™d love a frontend dev job, but Iâ€™m not stressing the timeline anymore.

## My Philosophy

> **Itâ€™s not the destination, itâ€™s the journey.** 

Iâ€™m embracing the process: the late-night debugging, the eureka moments, and the weird side tangents that lead to unexpectedly cool discoveries.

## Letâ€™s Connect

If youâ€™re also learning by diving into fun, sometimes random projectsâ€”or if you have any tips on networking (the part Iâ€™m trying to level up)â€”letâ€™s connect! Iâ€™m open to feedback, ideas, and new rabbit holes.
