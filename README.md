### About Me

I'm a **self-taught web developer** with a background in **AI and machine learning**. My goal is to **combine AI with web development** to build smarter, more useful applications. Right now, I'm grinding through **React and TypeScript**, improving frontend skills so I can bring AI-powered web apps to life.

I’m not just following tutorials—I’m coding **every single day**, breaking down problems, and rebuilding projects from scratch until I truly understand them.

### 📅 What I’m Working On Right Now

- **🖥️ Daily Coding** – Building projects in React, TypeScript, and APIs
- **📝 To-Do List App** – Rebuilding it daily to master state management & UI
- **🛒 Grocery List App (Possibly Coming Soon)** – Using real-time pricing APIs
- **🤖 AI-Powered Web App (Later Project)** – Thinking through how to integrate AI into web apps in **practical** ways

### 📅 My Goal for the Next Few Months

- **February:** 250+ hours of coding
- **March:** Start applying for jobs (450+ hours of coding + 50 hours networking)
- **April:** Fully built portfolio + aiming to get hired
- **May (if needed):** 650+ hours of coding, 100+ hours of networking

### 💾 GitHub Activity

- Pushing commits **daily** to track my progress
- Keeping my projects clean, improving them over time
- Open to feedback and collaboration

### Why I’m Doing This

I don’t just want to build websites—I want to **make them smarter with AI**. The demand for developers who can bridge the gap between web and AI is growing fast, and I’m making sure I have the skills to stand out.

If you're working on something similar, feel free to connect! I'm always open to learning from others and improving my approach.
